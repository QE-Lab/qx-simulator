/**
 * @class lockable_factory
 * @brief
 *   lockable_factory must be used as the unique (spin or mutex) factory,
 *  it's implemented as a singleton to ensure unique association of a lock
 *  to each given pointer. this factory is designed to avoid instanciation
 *  of multiples mutexes for a same resource to ensure data protection efficency.
